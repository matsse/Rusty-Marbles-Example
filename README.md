Marbles is a Proof of concept code snippet from one of my most recent project: Rusty Marbles.
Rusty marbles is a re-write of Marble Framework, which is a string obfuscation framework developed by the Central Intelligence Agency.


What is Marble Framework?

Marble framework is a string obfuscation framework written by the Central Intelligene Agency to be used in their projects. The knowledge of this framework 
were not made public until 2017, when Wikileaks released information about CIA's hacking tools and exploits, in a series called Vault7. 

More information about the framework can be found here: https://wikileaks.org/ciav7p1/cms/page_14588467.html

This code is intended to serve as an example of an obfuscation algorithm for Malware binaries written in rust.

I hereby tender to the notion that I, as the author of this re-write, distances myself from anyone who advocates
